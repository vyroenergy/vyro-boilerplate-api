# Vyro Boilerplate

> A boilerplate for integrating with Vyro.

This guide will help you set up an integration with Vyro.

## Prerequisites

### Credentials

You'll need some API credentials to get started. Visit [Vyro's developer portal](https://developers.vyro.co/docs/getting-started#credentials) for more information.

Once you have your credentials, rename `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the values.

### Local Environment

We recommend using **Node version 20** or greater. You'll also need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. You can install it globally with:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

_P.S the "p" in pnpm isn't a typo, it's an awesome package manager that is faster and more efficient than npm or yarn. Check it out!_

## Guides

We recommend following these guides in order to gain a gradual appreciation for the platform. That said, you're welcome to skip around if you prefer.
